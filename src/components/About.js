	            <h4>Iâ€™ve always been drawn to the overlap between design and development. I have a diverse set of skills, including HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React. I enjoy each aspect, and strive to build immersive web applications through carefully crafted code and user-centric design.</h4>
							<h4>When not coding, I enjoy digital and film photography, going to concerts, a friendly game of basketball, and spending time with my beautiful family.</h4>
